            This App demonstrates how to implement a low-level NFC card reader. This App
            is designed to read the Virtual IDCard card implemented in the "CardEmulation".\n\n

            In particular, this sample demonstrates how to disable Android Beam, select which AIDs the
            reader is interested, and establish communication with the card.
